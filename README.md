# Morse Code Encoder/Decoder

This is a simple Python-based Morse Code Encoder/Decoder tool. It allows users to convert text into Morse code and (soon) decode Morse code back into readable text. The project is ideal for beginners learning about string manipulation, dictionaries, and basic user input in Python.

## üöÄ Features

- ‚úÖ Encode text to Morse code
- ‚öôÔ∏è In-progress: Decode Morse code to text (with AI/ML-based intelligent decoding planned)
- Handles uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, punctuation, and special characters

## üì¶ How It Works

### Encoding Mode

- User inputs readable text.
- The program converts each character into its Morse equivalent using a predefined dictionary.
- If a character is not recognized, a `?` is appended in the Morse output.

### Decoding Mode *(Still in Development)*

- Will support decoding Morse code (even without spaces or slashes) using dictionary matching and possibly AI/ML to resolve ambiguous sequences or decode names.
- Intelligent decoding using language models and English dictionaries is planned.
